===============

**code-cells** is a Neovim plugin targeted primarily at
[Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) users. Jupytext allows
us to edit Jupyter notebooks as plain text documents. In these documents,
special comments are used to delimit notebook cells. This plugin makes it
easier to interact with such cells.

## Features

With this plugin, you can easily perform the following actions:

- TODO: Navigate between cells.
- TODO: Add new cells.
- TODO: Move cells up or down.
